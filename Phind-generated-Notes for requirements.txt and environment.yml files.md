Phind Generated Notes for Requirements.txt and Environment.yml
To create a `requirements.txt` file for pip installation and an `environment.yml` file for Conda installation, I'll first list all the Python packages used across the provided files and then format them accordingly for both pip and Conda environments. Here's a breakdown of the packages used in the project:

### Python Packages Used:
- json
- logging
- pandas
- docx
- re
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- streamlit
- faker
- st_aggrid
- itables                   # This is imported in the data_entry_gui.py module, but never used.
#- code_editor              # assumed to be a custom module, not available on PyPI or Conda
- streamlit_code_editor     # streamlit-code-editor, once installed is imported using "from code_editor import code_editor">
- numpy
- unittest                  # part of Python standard library, not needed in requirements

### requirements.txt
```
pandas
docx
matplotlib
seaborn
streamlit
faker
st_aggrid
```

### environment.yml
```yaml
name: prioritize-it
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pandas=1.3.4
  - python-docx=0.8.11
  - matplotlib=3.4.3
  - seaborn=0.11.2
  - streamlit=1.0.0
  - faker=10.0.0
  - st_aggrid=0.0.1
```

Note: The versions specified in `environment.yml` are the latest versions available on conda-forge as of my last update. You might want to adjust them based on your project's compatibility. Also, `code_editor` is assumed to be a custom module and not included in the Conda environment file. If it's a package available on PyPI but not on Conda, you can install it using pip within the Conda environment after creating it.

Please adjust the versions according to your project's compatibility and add any additional packages you might need.
