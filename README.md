## Prioritize It! - Task Prioritization Application

### Overview

Prioritize It! is a Python-based application designed to assist project managers and team leads in making data-driven decisions for task prioritization within their projects. Leveraging the Pareto principle (80/20 rule), this application aims to identify the critical few tasks that deliver the majority of the value to the customer, thereby streamlining the prioritization process, boosting team productivity, and enhancing project communication. It provides a centralized platform for task data entry, analysis, and visualization, helping users prioritize tasks based on their value and effort. The application supports various workflows, including spreadsheet data analysis, manual task entry, and demo data analysis, making it versatile for different project management needs.

### Features

- **Task Management**: Add, view, and remove tasks with ease. Each task includes a description, value (importance), and effort (work required), allowing for a comprehensive overview of project tasks.
- **Visualization**: Utilize Pareto charts and burndown charts to visualize task prioritization and project progress.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports on tasks, including total number, value, effort, and prioritization.
- **File Conversion**: Convert task data between JSON, TXT, and CSV formats for flexibility in data handling.
- **Demo Data Generation**: Quickly generate demo tasks for testing or demonstration purposes.
- **Interactive Grid**: Utilize an interactive grid for task management, offering functionalities like editing, filtering, and sorting.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: Visualize tasks using custom charts to understand project dynamics better.
