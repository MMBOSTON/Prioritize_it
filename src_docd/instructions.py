    Prioritize It! is a user-friendly Python application designed to empower project managers and team leads to make data-driven decisions when prioritizing tasks within their projects. 
    
    This application leverages the power of the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to identify the critical few tasks that deliver the majority of the value to the customer. 
    
    By providing a centralized platform for task data entry, analysis, and visualization, Prioritize It! aims to streamline the prioritization process, boost team productivity, and enhance project communication.
    
    This application helps you prioritize your tasks based on their value and effort. 

    Visualize your tasks using the 'Visualize Tasks' button to see Pareto charts and burndown charts.

    To use this application:

    1. Enter a new task in the 'Add a new task' section. Provide a task description, its [customer] value (how important it is), and the estimated effort (how much time work it will take to complete).
    2. Click the 'Add Task' button to add the task to the list.
    3. View your tasks in the 'View tasks' section. Tasks are sorted by their value-to-effort ratio, with the highest ratio tasks at the top.
    4. Generate a Report of your tasks by clicking the 'Generate Report' button.
