[{"description": "1. Integration of More Pre-trained Models\nDeep Learning Models: Explore integrating additional deep learning models such as EfficientNet, MobileNet, and DenseNet for image classification. This will allow users to choose from a wider range of models, potentially improving classification accuracy and speed.\n2. Custom Model Training Option\nCustom Model Training: Implement a feature that allows users to train their own models using a dataset of their choice. This could involve uploading a dataset, selecting a pre-trained model as a base, and training the model on the new dataset.\n3. Real-time Image Classification with Webcam\nWebcam Integration: Add functionality to classify images in real-time using a webcam. This would make the application more interactive and engaging for users.", "value": 0.0, "effort": 0.0, "id": null, "name": null, "ratio": 0}]
